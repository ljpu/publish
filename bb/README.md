# Nu Echo Coding Challenge

Hello and welcome to the Nu Echo Coding Challenge!

We'd like you to improve this small chatbot application.
You have **7 days** to submit your improved application for submission, but **please don't spend more than 10 hours on it**.

Feel free to stop whenever you are satisfied with the result, the goal is to showcase some of your skills and to have some content to discuss about.

We expect you to use whatever resources you need. Just like in the real world, feel free to use Google, Stack Overflow, to use additional dependencies, etc. 
Although, please make sure to make the work your own.

You can always reach out to us if you have any questions.

## Getting started

You need NodeJS >= 14.x

1. Copy this project to your computer
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` (or `yarn` if you prefer)
3. Run the project using `npm start` (or `yarn start`)
4. Try out the current use cases with the following words:

## Your Improvements

Your brief is to improve the bot. What that means is up to you!

Here are a few ideas:

- find out which CH hockey player you are, based on height, anniversary, eye color, etc.
- find out when and where you should go out camping next, based on weather, outdoor activities available, etc.
- find what book to read next, based on your interests.

You can also improve the chatbot in other areas such as :

- technical quality (architecture, test coverage, etc.)
- conversational quality (interactivity, NLU, messages, etc.) 

This is a non-exhaustive list. As mentioned above, improve the chatbot however you see fit!

### End Goal

In the end, we want a sample of how you work and have something to talk to you about after the challenge :)

We want to know how the challenge went for you, how much time you put in, what difficulties you faced, etc. 
For example, we will ask you about your technical decisions, how you managed the trade-offs between development speed and quality.
But also how you prioritized the tasks you wanted to achieve and what you envision as the next steps for the project.

## Submitting your solution

Feel free to modify this README with details on your solution (e.g. an overview of your modifications, shortcomings).

Create an archive of your solution **with your full name as part of the filename** and send it via a reply to the original challenge email within **7 days**.

If you have any questions please contact us and we will be happy to help out.

Good luck!
